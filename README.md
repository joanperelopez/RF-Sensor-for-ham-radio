# RF Sensor for ham radio
Not everything we amateur radio enthusiasts do is perfect, and that includes antennas and their proper matching to the transmission line. When impedance matching isn’t perfect, the well-known standing waves (SWR) occur. Another related phenomenon is the circulation of RF energy through the outer shield of the coaxial cable. The device I’m about to present to you serves to detect these currents.

This device does not require any kind of battery or power supply. It only needs to be brought close to a coaxial cable to detect the presence of RF.

As can be seen in the schematic, it is composed of four OA90 germanium diodes, a 100nF capacitor, and an LED (preferably red, as they tend to have lower saturation voltages). 
The labels PAD and RING appear in the schematic, which I will explain below.

For its construction, we will need all the materials shown in the photograph:  
- Copper adhesive tape.  
- Plastic pieces to house all the sensor components.  
- 1 LED diode.  
- A small PCB to solder the electronic components.  
- Various connecting wires.
