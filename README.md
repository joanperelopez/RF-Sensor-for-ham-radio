# RF Sensor for ham radio
Not everything we amateur radio enthusiasts do is perfect, and that includes antennas and their proper matching to the transmission line. When impedance matching isn’t perfect, the well-known standing waves (SWR) occur. Another related phenomenon is the circulation of RF energy through the outer shield of the coaxial cable. The device I’m about to present to you serves to detect these currents.

This device does not require any kind of battery or power supply. It only needs to be brought close to a coaxial cable to detect the presence of RF.

As can be seen in the schematic, it is composed of four OA90 germanium diodes, a 100nF capacitor, and an LED (preferably red, as they tend to have lower saturation voltages). 
The labels PAD and RING appear in the schematic, which I will explain below.

For its construction, we will need all the materials shown in the photograph:  
- Copper adhesive tape.  
- Plastic pieces to house all the sensor components.  
- 1 LED diode.  
- A small PCB to solder the electronic components.  
- Various connecting wires.

The PAD. We will stick a circular piece of copper as shown in the photograph and solder a wire to it. This pad is responsible for picking up the RF, specifically the electric field of the signal.

In a perfectly matched transmission line, the current flowing through the central conductor is exactly equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the current flowing through the shield. The magnetic fields (H) generated by the central conductor and the shield cancel each other out, as do the electric fields. When the currents in the central conductor and the shield are of different magnitudes, the cancellation is not complete, and this is when we can detect currents on the shield of the cable (what we refer to as RF returns).

The RING. We will stick a 10mm-wide strip of copper in the shape shown in the photograph and solder a wire to it. 

This ring forms an electrode, which capacitively couples with our fingers to provide a return path for the RF and increases the sensitivity of the sensor. In any case, the sensor already has some intrinsic sensitivity, but less than if we bring our fingers close.

We solder the LED wires, the PAD, and the RING to the PCB, and we’ll almost be done. We’ll need to place the LED in its position and add a bit of hot glue. The PCB should be placed inside the plastic cylinder with a bit of hot glue, ensuring it doesn’t cause any short circuits with the RING. Next, we put the cap in place, also securing it with a few drops of hot glue, and our sensor will be complete.

You can now use your sensor. Set the transceiver to tune mode or CW so that it transmits a carrier. Press and hold the PTT or CW key, then place the sensor on the antenna's coaxial cable, as shown in the photograph. The LED lighting up will indicate the presence of RF on the cable's shield.
